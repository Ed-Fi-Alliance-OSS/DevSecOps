# Ed-Fi Repo Auditor

Python script to report on compliance with Ed-Fi repository guidance. The file
[scoring.json](./scoring.json) provides the guidelines to be followed; see below
for a detailed description in plain text. The property names are in the same
format that the code will follow to assign a value. This file provides a value
for each property, this file can be modified accordingly. Additionally, the
`threshold` property specifies the limit that will be tolerated to indicate if
the repository needs to make adjustments according to the scoring.
